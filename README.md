# Parva-Capsula
GI Smart Pill- A non-invasive approach to gut health & gastrointestinal diagnosis

This will be a swallowable capsule with an IoT sensor and a micro camera, replacing the traditional highly invasive colonoscopy and endoscopy procedures. 

The smart pill is the size of a vitamin pill that contains an IoT sensor, a micro camera, onboard diagnostics tools, and runs on state-of-the-art nanotechnology. 

The onboard diagnostics tools utilize the sensor to detect the presence of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen in the gut. 

Additionally, the micro camera takes several pictures and short videos and sends them to the paired Bluetooth device before swallowing the capsule. 

Our neutral network-powered deep learning algorithm further analyzes the images and videos outlining potential inflammation, cancer symptoms, ulcerative colitis, food fermentation in the gut or microbiome activity. 

Through research at the HPCC systems, Parva's model is able to achieve an industry leading accuracy for diagnosis.
